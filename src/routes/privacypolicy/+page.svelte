    <h2>FoundTech Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Updated: May 24th, 2023</p>

    <h3>Personal Data we Collect</h3>

    <p>FoundTech collects data from you, through our interactions with you and through our products.
    You provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your
    interactions, use, and experiences with our products. The data we collect depends on the
    context of your interactions with FoundTech and the choices you make, including your privacy
    settings and the products and features you use. We also obtain data about you from third
    parties.</p>
    
    <p>You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When we
    ask you to provide personal data, you can decline. Many of our products require some personal
    data to provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide data required to provide you with
    a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect
    personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the
    data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this relates to an existing product you’re
    using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time.
    Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like
    personalization that use such data will not work for you.</p>

    <p>When you subscribe to a FoundTech Cloud service and create your own database, any
    information or content you submit or upload into your database is your own, and you control it
    fully. This data will often include personal information, for example: your list of employees, your
    contacts and customers, your messages, pictures, videos, etc. We only ever collect this
    information on your behalf, and you always retain ownership and full control on this data.</p>
    
    <h3>How we Use Personal Data</h3>

    <p>FoundTech uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive experiences. In
    particular, we use data to:</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 1em;">a) Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as
    providing support. It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service
    or carry out the transactions you request</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 1em;">b) Improve and develop our products</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 1em;">c) Personalize our products and make recommendations</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 1em;">d) Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications,
    targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 1em;">e) We use your contact information in order to provide our services, to answer your
    requests, and for billing and account management reasons</p>

    <p>We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance,
    meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.</p>
    
    <p>In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts or obtain
    from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to
    make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.</p>
    
    <p>Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual
    (human) methods of processing. Our automated methods often are related to and supported by
    our manual methods. For example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI),
    which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and
    assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do. To build,
    train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we
    manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods
    against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made.</p>
    
    <h3>Accessing, Updating or Deleting Your Personal Information</h3>
    
    <p>You have the right to access and update personal data you have previously provided to us. You
    can do so at any time by connecting to your personal account. If you wish to permanently delete
    your account or personal information for a legitimate purpose, please contact our Helpdesk to
    request so. We will take all reasonable steps to permanently delete your personal information,
    except when we are required to keep it for legal reasons (typically, for administration, billing and
    tax reporting reasons).</p>

    <p>Customer Database: You can manage any data collected in your databases hosted on
    FoundTech at any time, using your administration credentials, including modifying or deleting
    any personal data stored therein. You may also request the deletion of your entire database via
    your control panel, at any time.</p>
    
    <h3>Reasons we Share Personal Data</h3>
    
    <p>We share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any
    product you have requested or authorized. We also share data with FoundTech-controlled
    affiliates and subsidiaries; with vendors working on our behalf; when required by law or to
    respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of
    our products; and to protect the rights and property of FoundTech and its customers.</p>
    
    <p>Please note that, as defined under certain U.S. state data privacy laws, “sharing” also relates to
    providing personal data to third parties for personalized advertising purposes.</p>
    
    <h3>How to Access and Control Your Personal Data</h3>
    
    <p>You can also make choices about the collection and use of your data by FoundTech. You can
    control your personal data that FoundTech has obtained, and exercise your data protection
    rights, by contacting FoundTech or using various tools we provide. In some cases, your ability to
    access or control your personal data will be limited, as required or permitted by applicable law.
    How you can access or control your personal data will also depend on which products you use.</p>
    
    <h3>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
    
    <p>Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web
    server in the domain that placed the cookie. We use cookies and similar technologies for storing
    and honoring your preferences and settings, enabling you to sign in, providing interest-based
    advertising, combating fraud, analyzing how our products perform, and fulfilling other legitimate
    purposes.</p>
    
    <p>You have a variety of tools to control the data collected by cookies, and similar technologies. For
    example, you can use controls in your internet browser to limit how the websites you visit are
    able to use cookies and to withdraw your consent by clearing or blocking cookies.</p>
    
    <p>Cookies are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current
    activity on our website (the pages you have visited), your language and country, which enables
    us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate
    data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools
    in the future.</p>

    FoundTech and your organization. FoundTech processes your personal data to provide the
    product to your organization and you. As mentioned above, if you have questions about
